This is a classic “Snake Game” created using Android Studio. On clicking on the start button, the snake moves in up, down, right or left directions at a constant speed and has to eat the apple/disk which appears at a particular location on the screen. When the snake "eats" (runs into) an apple, it gets longer. The player has one life and the game continues until the snake "dies". A snake dies by either (1) running into the edge of the board, or (2) by running into its own tail. The final score is based on the number of apples eaten by the snake. The game also keeps a track of the score and high score of the player and has a sound button which can be toggled on/off.
